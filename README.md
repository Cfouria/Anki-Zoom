# Anki-Zoom

### Removed mouse ~C4ia

Zoom add-on for Anki, forked from [ospalh/anki-addons](https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons).

The add-on allows you to:
- zoom in or out with `Ctrl + +`/`Ctrl + -`
- or with `Ctrl + mouse wheel`
- or with the `View >> Zoom` menu.

This add-on plays well with [Anki-Night-Mode](https://github.com/krassowski/Anki-Night-Mode).


### After installation

If you encounter any issues, let me know writing an [issue](https://github.com/krassowski/Anki-Zoom/issues) on GitHub.


If you like the addon, plese give it a star here and on the Anki webpage.


### For developers
